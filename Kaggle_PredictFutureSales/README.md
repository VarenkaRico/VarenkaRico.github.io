# Project Title: Predict Future Sales (Kaggle Competition)

## ðŸ“š **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of sales of one of the largest Russian software firms 1C. The information is provided in a daily basis from January 2013 up to October 2015. The project handles data processing, cleaning, and enrichment tasks by applying Python-based data analysis techniques. As well as ARIMA timeseries analysis and prediction of sales for the next 12 months.
