                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                </div>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        The Paris Agreement has established the objective of limiting greenhouse gas emissions to ensure that the global temperature increase remains well below 2°C above 
                        pre-industrial levels. However, it has also been widely recognized that striving for a more ambitious target of limiting the increase to 1.5°C would result in 
                        significantly lower climate change impacts. Consequently, the signatory countries of the agreement have committed to working towards this more stringent target.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        This temperature change is not evaluated on a monthly or yearly basis due to the inherent natural variability of the climate. Instead, a long-term perspective, 
                        typically over a 10-year period, is used to assess progress. This long-term approach accounts for short-term fluctuations caused by natural phenomena, 
                        ensuring that trends rather than isolated events are the focus.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">   
                        Nevertheless, an individual year with a temperature increase exceeding 1.5°C should not be overlooked. Such an occurrence is particularly concerning if it aligns with 
                        an upward trend rather than a constant or declining trajectory. This is especially critical given that reports have already highlighted a general increase in global 
                        temperatures. Persistent upward trends underscore the urgency of achieving the Paris Agreement’s objectives to mitigate the severe consequences of climate change.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        The IMF has made available a yearly database with the information of the temperature change for each country (
                            <a href="https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/4063314923d74187be9596f10d034914/about" target ="_blank">IMF Climate Data</a>). 
                        The information shows the change in surface temperature measure against a baseline between 1951-1980.

                        The objectives of the current analysis is to:
                        <li>Identify patterns in data</li>
                        <li>Cluster countries based on the change in temperature variable</li>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Exploring the data, the information is cleaned and transformed. A sample of the resulting country dataframe is shown to exemplify:
                    <li><b>Country</b>, <b>ISO2</b> and <b>ISO3</b> are related, there should be no duplicates in these variables.
                        This might be important when working with other data sources, ISO2 or ISO3 could be used as variables to merge information when needed, since country names
                        may vary from data sources due to abbreviations (Rep. Vs Republic), language (France Vs Francia), spelling (México Vs Méjico) or the use of names in official 
                        language Vs translation (Cotê d'Ivoire Vs Ivory Coast). To maintain consistancy, ISO2 will be used and the other 2 variables with ISO2 included, will be kept in a 
                        different dataframe to keep the relation and when needed, be used for clarity. 
                        Analyzing further, continents (Africa, Americas, Antartica, Asia, Europe, Oceania) and the World consolidated information are also included, so these regions will be 
                        separated from the database of countries to be used accordingly (the regions do not present any null value).</li>
                    <li><b>Indicator</b> has only one vale (Temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951-1980) which is mentioned and should
                        be only considered for context but it does not provide additional information for each country.</li>
                    <li><b>Source</b>, <b>CTS_Code</b>, <b>CTS_Name</b> and <b>CTS_Full_Descriptor</b> have only one value. Since they do not enrich the analysis and are common for 
                        all countries, they will be dropped from the dataframe to have a more efficient analysis process, but will be considered in all the process to correctly
                        inform the results.</li>
                    <li><b>Unit</b> has only one value (Celsius). Once confirmed all temperature changes are expressed in Celsius (°C), data will not need to be converted from or to 
                        another unit system. It will also be dropped from the dataframe, but kept in mind through all the analysis and conclusions.</li>
                    <li><b>Indicator</b> has only one value (Temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951-1980). Since it does not give any 
                        additional information, it will be dropped from de dataframe to have a more efficient analysis process, but it will be considered in all the process to correctly
                        inform the results.</li>
                    <li><b>F1961 - F2023</b> are the changes in temperature respect to a baseline. This variables will be unpivoted so there is an additional variable (column) 'Year' and 
                    the corresponding variable 'TempChange'. This will help with the analysis performance. Additionally, a 'Year_Num' as a discrete variable instead of categorical.</li>

                    The world subset contains no null or missing values for the temperature change variable. A general statistical analysis is presented below. 
                    However, since the data represents a time series, the analysis should not be interpreted without considering the temporal context. 
                    Key observations include that the lowest recorded drop in temperature relative to the baseline is <b>-0.313°C</b>, while the highest recorded increase is <b>1.767°C</b>. 
                    Without the inclusion of time as a factor, these figures provide limited insights.

                    From the graph below, a clear trend of increasing global temperatures emerges. 
                    While there are years where the recorded increase is lower than that of the preceding year, the overall trajectory over the 63 years is undeniably upward. 
                    This trend has been extensively studied and consistently linked to human activity. 
                    Combining the graph with the statistical summary, we observe that the most significant temperature decrease occurred in 1976, while the largest increase was recorded in 2023. 
                    These findings highlight the ongoing and critical issue of global warming.

                    Since 1978 (with the exception of 1985), the global temperature has remained above the baseline. 
                    In 1998, it exceeded +1°C for the first time, and since 2012, it has consistently stayed above this threshold, with an ongoing upward trend. 
                    Moreover, the time required for temperature increases of +0.5°C intervals has been shortening. 
                    It took approximately 23 years to rise from 0°C to +0.5°C, around 15 years to increase from +0.5°C to +1°C, and near 13 years to transition from +1°C to +1.5°C. 
                    This acceleration underscores the urgency of addressing global warming trends.

                <p>From the graph on the left, it is clear that the 6 continents have an increasing trend, being Europe the continent with the most upward trend of all.
                    Asia, the Americas and Africa have a very similar trend around the world's average.
                    Although the Antartica is the continent with the lowest increase trend, and was up to 1990 in a steady one, it has increase
                    gradually and the temperatures below the baseline are less common since 2005.                   
                </p>
                <p>The second graph shows the latitude coverage of each continent. 
                    There seems to be a correlation between the latitude ranges, with the actual trend.
                    For example, being the Americas the longest continent, covering almost all the latitudes, the average increase is the nearest
                    to that of the world. Continents north to the Equator (Latitude 0), seem to have a higher trend from those in the south.
                    Notice it is not related to the length (in latitude coverage) related, since continents with similar range have different trends.
                    Another option could be that the trend could relate to the continental mass, but it looks like this is not the case since Asia
                    is the biggest continent (43.8M km2), then the Americas (42.3M km2), Africa (30.3M km2), Antartica (13.7M km2), Europe (10.2M km2)
                    and finally Oceania (8.7M km2).
                </p>
                <p>The objective of this analysis is to prove that the impact of increase in temperature is related to the latitude coverage. 
                    In order to do so, the analysis should be done by country (the smallest region available for anlaysis in the dataset from the IMF).
                    If this hypothesis is correct, countries north to the Equator should have a statistically significant higher trend from 
                    those in the south, even when they are in the same continent. And countries from different continents, but with similar 
                    latitudinal range, should have a similar trend.

                            While <b>12 countries</b> have only a single missing value, the country with the highest count is <b>Virgin Islands</b>, 
                            reporting <b>57 missing values</b>.    
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Several strategies can be considered to address these missing values:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Remove rows containing missing values</li>
                                <li>Remove columns with missing values</li>
                                <li>Impute missing data (e.g., with averages, estimated trends, or correlated variables)</li>
                                <li>Leave the missing values as nulls</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Removing entire columns is not viable, as the missing values are not concentrated in a specific time period or year. 
                            This can be observed in the following nall data mapping. That said, some patterns are still noticeable — 
                            for example, years prior to <b>1992</b> show higher instances of missing data across multiple countries.
                            Each case will be evaluated individually to determine the most appropriate handling method.

                        <p> For countries with extensive missing data — particularly when the number of missing years exceeds the number of valid data years — 
                            row deletion may be considered. However, this approach will factor in the country's size. 
                            Larger countries typically cover broader geographic areas, especially in latitude, making their exclusion more impactful. 
                            To establish a cut-off, countries falling within the <b>bottom 5% (q05)</b> in terms of land area (approximately <b>900 km²</b> or less) 
                            are considered candidates for removal. This threshold affects up to <b>12 countries</b>.

                        <p>
                            Whether these small-area countries overlap with those having significant missing data is yet to be determined. 
                            However, they are currently flagged for potential exclusion.

                        <p>
                            Based on the analysis of missing data and surface area, a total of <b>six countries</b> will be excluded from further analysis. 
                            These countries either have extremely limited data coverage or fall within the bottom 5% (<b>q05</b>) of surface area, 
                            making them unreliable or statistically insignificant for meaningful inclusion. The selected countries are: 
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>British Virgin Islands (VG)</b>: Only 6 records are available, covering 1961 to 1966, with a surface of 151 km2.</li>
                                <li><b>Turks and Caicos Islands (TC)</b>: Records exist for 1961 - 1966 and 1971 - 1974.
                                    Despite having a surface area above the q05 threshold, the <b>sparse data distribution</b> makes reliable imputation strategies infeasible. </li>
                                <li><b>Nauru (NR)</b>: Records from 1961, 1966 and the period 1971 - 1978, with a surface of 21 km2.</li>
                                <li><b>Falkand Islands (FK)</b>: Data covers only the period 1961 - 1970. 
                                    Although the surface area is above q05, the <b>data coverage is too limited</b> for meaningful analysis, leading to its exclusion.</li>
                                <li><b>Niue (NU)</b>: Records span 1961 to 1992, but the surface area is below q05.</li>
                                <li><b>Pitcairn (PN)</b>: Records cover 1961 to 2010, but the surface area is below q05.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rest of the countries will be kept for analysis. Different approaches will be used to impute missing data.
